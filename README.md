[![downloads](https://img.shields.io/sourceforge/dt/proxmark3gui.svg?label=SourceForge%20downloads)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/proxmark3gui/)  

A cross-platform GUI for [Proxmark3](https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3)/[Proxmark3 Iceman fork](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3) client  

(The [orignal Proxmark3 repo](https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3) has been unmaintained for a long time. I personally suggest using the [Proxmark3 Iceman fork](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3))

## About Compiled Windows clients

A cool guy [Gator96100](https://github.com/Gator96100) creates [ProxSpace](https://github.com/Gator96100/ProxSpace) and makes it possible to compile both the firmware and the client on Windows.  
Also, he makes the [pre-compiled Windows client](https://www.proxmarkbuilds.org/) so you can download it and run your PM3 client on Windows instantly.  
I included his compiled client in my releases so you can use the GUI on the fly, and you can also use the GUI with your prefered client.  
Great thanks to him.

## Download binaries for Windows 
You can download pre-built Windows binaries in [release](https://github.com/wh201906/Proxmark3GUI/releases) page  
`Vx.x.x-win64.7z` only contains the GUI  
`Vx.x.x-win64-xxxxxxx.7z` contains the GUI and corresponding client. You just need to open `Vx.x.x-win64-xxxxxxx\GUI\Proxmark3GUI.exe`  

You can also download them in SourceForge  
[![Download Proxmark3GUI](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/sf-download-button)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/proxmark3gui/files/latest/download)
